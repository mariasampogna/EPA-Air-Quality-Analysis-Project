# EPA-Air-Quality-Analysis

For this project, I analyzed open-source air quality data from the EPA's AirNow site. The data I used included information on daily readings from several sites in each US state in 2022 for several gasses that impact air quality. I conducted an exploratory analysis, followed by linear regression and cluster analysis. 

## Context

The analysis sought to identify what relationships, if any, existed between the various gasses. By analyzing these relationships, I hoped to uncover which states had the worst air quality levels, how these levels changed throughout the year, and which gasses have the most impact on overall air quality.

## Data

This project uses a the 2022 daily reading datasets fro Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulfur Dioxide, accessed from the [EPA's open source data site](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html ).

Descriptions of the data and formats can be found [here](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/FileFormats.html#_daily_summary_files%20).

More information about the Air Quality Index can be found [here](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

## Scripts and Documentation

The attached scripts are all in the format of Jupyter notebooks and include all code used for the analysis. In addition to these scripts, a Tableu stroyboard summarizing analysis and results can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/2022USAirQualityAnalysis/2022USAirQualityAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ).
